          Dirty Birds was established in 1931, in the mist of the great depression.
          Ceceil O’Bird’s goal of opening Dirty Birds at such a rough time was to
          offer cheaper but amazing tasting food, not to make profit but to help get
          food for the people in need. Almost a century has past and Dirty Birds has
          never strived so much, producing the worlds best chicken for all to eat!
